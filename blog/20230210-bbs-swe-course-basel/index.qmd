We covered topics from R package basics over development workflows, quality, and modern collaboration tools to publishing. We consider democratizing these skills crucial to foster a vibrant R package ecosystem in biostatics. Even if you do not intend to write your own package, a solid understanding of how all of this fits together enables you to participate in the community and positively influence future development by reporting bugs, giving feedback, or bringing your methodological expertise to the table of open-source development.

We thank the BBS for supporting the workshop, Roche for hosting the event, and the participants for a lively and inspiring atmosphere.
