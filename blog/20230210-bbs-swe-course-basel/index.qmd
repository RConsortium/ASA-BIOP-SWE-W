On Friday February 10, Daniel, Friedrich, and Kevin held
a one-day workshop on good software engineering practice for R
(GSWEP4R) in Basel. In order to achieve the best learning experience for participants, we only offered this course face to face without dialing in option - and the 50 seats had been booked out quickly within days after the course had been announced.

We covered topics from R package basics over development workflows,
quality, and modern collaboration tools to publishing.
We consider democratizing these skills crucial to foster
a vibrant R package ecosystem in biostatics.
Even if you do not intend to write your own package,
a solid understanding of how all of this fits together
enables you to participate in the community and positively
influence future development by reporting bugs, giving feedback,
or bringing your methodological expertise to the table of
open-source development.

We thank the BBS for supporting the workshop, Roche for
hosting the event, and the participants for a lively and
inspiring atmosphere.

The course materials are online under CC-BY license [here](https://kkmann.github.io/workshop-r-swe/) and the source code for
all materials is available [here](https://github.com/kkmann/workshop-r-swe).
We might migrate them to an organisational repository soon.
We also plan to repeat the course in other locations in the future - please reach out if you are interested to work with the SWE WG to host a course!
