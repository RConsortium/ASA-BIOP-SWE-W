On Friday February 10, Daniel, Friedrich, and Kevin held
a one-day workshop on good software engineering practice for R
(GSWEP4R) in Basel.
In order to achieve the best learning experience for
participants, we only offered this course face to face without dialing in
option - and the 50 seats had been booked out quickly within days after the
course had been announced.

We covered topics from R package basics over development workflows, quality,
and modern collaboration tools to publishing. We consider democratizing these
skills crucial to foster a vibrant R package ecosystem in biostatics.
Even if you do not intend to write your own package,
a solid understanding of how all of this fits together enables you to
participate in the community and positively influence future development
by reporting bugs, giving feedback, or bringing your methodological expertise
to the table of open-source development.

We thank the BBS for supporting the workshop, Roche for hosting the event,
and the participants for a lively and inspiring atmosphere.

We also plan to repeat the course in other locations in the future
- please reach out if you are interested to work with the SWE WG to
host a course!
