The SWE WG got a new short name as **openstatsware**, which stands for **open**-source **stat**i**s**tical soft**ware**. The new short name reflects the objects of the WG, which are to engineer high-quality open-source statistical software and to develop and disseminate the best practices for the process. 

A new logo has been created to align with the new short name. Credit to Alessandro for designing the new logo.
