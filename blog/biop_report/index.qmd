In the [Fall edition of the Biopharmaceutical Report](https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/AMSTAT/fa4dd52c-8429-41d0-abdf-0011047bfa19/UploadedImages/BIOP%20Report/BioPharm_fall2022FINAL.pdf) we start from the importance of reliable software for statistical analyses, in particular in the pharmaceutical industry. We explain that the increase in using open source software is increasing the criticality of this topic, and summarize the progress that has been made by different initiatives around R in particular. Finally we motivate the creation of our new working group with the fact that little attention seems to have been devoted to good software engineering in biostatistics.
