  The SWE WG is a scientific working group of the [American Statistical Association (ASA) Biopharmaceutical section (BIOP)](https://community.amstat.org/biop/home).
  
  Our goals are to:
  
  * **Collaborate to engineer selected R-packages** to fill in gaps in the open-source statistical software landscape, and promote software tools designed by the working group through publications, conference presentations, workshops, and training courses, etc
  
  * **Develop best practices for engineering high-quality statistical software**, and promote the use of best practices in the broader Biostatistics community via public training materials
  
  * **Communicate and collaborate** with other R software initiatives
