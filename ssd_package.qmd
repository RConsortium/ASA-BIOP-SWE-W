title: "Bayesian Safety Signal Detection Julia Package"
---

**Lead**: Daniel Sabanes Bove (Roche)

**Objective**: To develop a Julia package for Bayesian Safety Signal Detection based on the [Brock et al (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/pst.2278) method.

```{r, label = "active", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "asis"}
path <- getwd()
source(file = paste(path, "/utils/read_members.R", sep = ""))
read.members("SSD")
```
