Our goals are to:

-   **Engineer selected R-packages** to fill in gaps in the open-source statistical software landscape, and to promote software tools designed by the working group through publications, conference presentations, workshops, and training courses.

-   **Develop good SWE practices** for engineering high-quality statistical software and promote their use in the broader Biostatistics community via public training materials.

-   **Communicate and collaborate** with other R software initiatives including via the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).
