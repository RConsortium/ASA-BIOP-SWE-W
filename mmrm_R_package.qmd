title: "MMRM R Package Development"
---

**Lead**: Daniel Sabanes Bove (Roche)

**Objective**: To develop a comprehensive R package for mixed models with repeated measures (MMRM) that is robust, well documented and thoroughly tested.

```{r, label = "active", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "asis"}
path <- getwd()
source(file = paste(path, "/utils/read_members.r", sep = ""))
read.members("MMRM")

```
