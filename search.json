Visualizations can be very helpful here and we created a video showing the first six months of development of the mmrm R package. The video is based on the cumulative commit history of the git repository where the package development happens. It shows contributions to the “main” branch of the repository and how contributors add or edit files. Files are visualized by dots and arranged in a tree structure defined by the folders in the repository. The video is optimized for full HD quality.\n\n\nOnly direct code contributions are shown. This does not include, ideation, community organization, code reviews, bug reporting, or answering questions, and promoting the package - all of which are important to make such a project a long-term success.\nIf you want to co-star in the next iteration of the video, check out the mmrm git repository, get in touch and contribute! Our contribution guidelines can be found here.\nWe used gource to create the video following an example and guide by Nan Xiao."

    "title": "New ASA BIOP working group on Software Engineering",
    "section": "",
    "text": "With the shift of biostatistics work from proprietary software (e.g. SAS) to R, it is now even more important to write reliable and reproducible code, and to be selective with the R packages we use. This topic is equally relevant for biostatistics work as it is for programming and other roles. A recent panel discussion on this topic highlighted this evolving need across companies and academia.\nTo foster collaboration within biostatistics across organizational silos we proposed a new scientific working group under the umbrella of the American Statistical Association (ASA) Biopharmaceutical section (BIOP) which was quickly approved in August this year: The Software Engineering working group (SWE WG). Now we have launched our landing page and website (hosted by the R Consortium GitHub organization) and want to share this news broadly to raise awareness and attract contributors. We have more than 10 companies and institutions involved in the SWE WG and welcome new members.\nThe primary objective of the SWE WG is to engineer R packages that implement important methods that are often utilized in biostatistics but still missing from our R toolbox. The first product is the recently-published R package implementing mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM): mmrm. In particular, a critical advantage of this package over existing implementations is that it is faster and converges more reliably. It also provides a comprehensive set of features: users can specify a variety of covariance matrices, weight observations, fit models with restricted or standard maximum likelihood inference, perform hypothesis testing with Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom, and extract the least square means estimates by using the emmeans package. We aim to establish the R package mmrm as a new standard for fitting MMRM and will communicate it broadly. We welcome any community contributions to the R package, including feedback, questions and feature requests.\nThe secondary objective is to develop best practices for engineering high-quality open-source statistical software, and to promote the use of these best practices in the broader biostatistics community via public training materials.\n➞ Would you like to try out the new package mmrm? Install it from CRAN and read the documentation (hosted by the openpharma GitHub organization).\n➞ What do you think is missing in the statisticians’ R toolbox? Comment here!\n➞ Are you developing R packages and are interested in joining the working group? Please visit our website on how to join (no ASA membership required)."

In order to achieve the best learning experience for participants, we only offered this course face to face without dialing in option - and the 50 seats had been booked out quickly within days after the course had been announced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe covered topics from R package basics over development workflows, quality, and modern collaboration tools to publishing. We consider democratizing these skills crucial to foster a vibrant R package ecosystem in biostatics. Even if you do not intend to write your own package, a solid understanding of how all of this fits together enables you to participate in the community and positively influence future development by reporting bugs, giving feedback, or bringing your methodological expertise to the table of open-source development.\nWe thank the BBS for supporting the workshop, Roche for hosting the event, and the participants for a lively and inspiring atmosphere.\nThe course materials are online under CC-BY license here and the source code for all materials is available here.\nWe also plan to repeat the course in other locations in the future - please reach out if you are interested to work with the SWE WG to host a course!"
