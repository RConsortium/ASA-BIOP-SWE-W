title: "Bayesian MMRM R Package Development"
---

**Lead**: Will Landau (Eli Lilly)

**Objective**: To develop an R package for Bayesian mixed models with repeated measures (MMRM) to support robust analysis of longitudinal clinical data.

```{r, label = "active", echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "asis"}
path <- getwd()
source(file = paste(path, "/utils/read_members.R", sep = ""))
read.members("bayesian_mmrm")
```
