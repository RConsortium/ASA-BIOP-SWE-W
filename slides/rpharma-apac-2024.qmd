# Introducing openstatsware

## openstatsware

```{r calc-stats}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
members <- read_csv("../data/members.csv") |> filter(SWE_WG_Member == 1)
n_members <- nrow(members)
unique_orgs <- members |> pull("Affiliation") |> unique() |> sort()

-   Formed on 19 August 2022
-   Official working group of the [American Statistical Association (ASA) Biopharmaceutical section (BIOP)](https://community.amstat.org/biop/home)
-   Special Interest Group (SIG) of the [European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (EFSPI)](https://www.efspi.org/).
-   Cross-industry collaboration (`r n_members` members from `r length(unique_orgs)` organizations)

## Motivation

-   Open-source software increasingly popular in Biostatistics
    -   Rapid uptake of novel statistical methods
    -   Unprecedented opportunities for collaboration
    -   Transparency of methods and implementation
-   Variability in software quality
    -   No statistical quality assurance on open-source extension package repositories, e.g. CRAN
    -   No industry standard for assessing quality of R packages
-   **Reliable software for core statistical analyses is paramount**

# Our work

## openstatsware objectives

-   **Engineer selected packages** to fill in gaps in the open-source statistical software landscape, and to promote software tools designed by the working group through publications, conference presentations, workshops, and training courses.

-   **Develop good SWE practices** for engineering high-quality statistical software and promote their use in the broader Biostatistics community via public training materials.

-   **Communicate and collaborate** with other R software initiatives including via the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/). 


## Workstreams in Package Development

-   Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRM)
    -   Developed the [`mmrm`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mmrm) R package for frequentist inference in MMRM
-   Bayesian MMRM
    -   Developed the [`brms.mmrm`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brms.mmrm) R package for Bayesian inference in MMRM
-   Health Technology Assessment (HTA)
    -   Developed the [`maicplus`](https://hta-pharma.github.io/maicplus/) R package for matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC)
-   Bayesian Safety Signal Detection 
    -   Developed the [`SafetySignalDetection.jl`](https://openpharma.github.io/SafetySignalDetection.jl/) Julia package

## Best Practices Dissemination - Workshop

-   Workshop "Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages" on world tour
-   To teach hands-on skills and tools to engineer reliable R packages
    -   Topics: R package structure, engineering workflow, ensuring quality, version control, collaboration and publication, and shiny development
-   5 events in 2023 in Basel, Shanghai, San José, Rockville, and Montreal
-   4 events in 2024 in Zurich, Salzburg, Beijing, and this Monday [online at R/Pharma APAC](https://openpharma.github.io/workshop-r-swe-rinpharma-2024/)!

## Best Practices Dissemination - openstatsguide

- Small and concise set of recommendations for package developers
- Opinionated, but aims to be based on experienced majority opinions
- Focus are developers, while users might find complementary "validation" frameworks valuable
- Primarily for statistical packages (not plotting, data wrangling, etc.)
- Generic principles which can be used across functional data science languages R, Python, and Julia
- Concrete tools are mentioned as examples

# Outlook

## Long Term Perspective

-   Software engineering is a critical competence in producing high-quality statistical software
-   A lot of work needs to be done regarding the establishment, dissemination and adoption of best practices for engineering open-source software
-   Improving the way software engineering is done will help improve the efficiency, reliability and innovation within Biostatistics

## Next Steps

-   Join the Effective Statistician conference invited session organized by `openstatsware`
-   We will relaunch the CRAN Task View on Clinical Trials
-   We are considering to write a Shiny app development guide
