## Agenda

-   Overview of Open Source in Biostatistics
-   Case Study: `{mmrm}` Package
    -   Mixed Models for Repeated Measures - Why bother?
    -   Why this is not "yet another package"
-   Lessons Learned
-   Next Steps

## Open Source in Biostatistics

-   Open-source software has gained increasing popularity in Biostatistics
    -   Pros: rapid uptake of novel statistical methods, unprecedented opportunities for collaboration
    -   Cons: variability in software quality
-   Importance of reliable software for statistical analysis cannot be underestimated

## Open Source in Biostatistics (cont'd)

-   Current repositories (GitHub, CRAN):
    -   Do not require any statistical quality assurance
    -   Hard to adopt packages without good documentation and maintenance
-   High-quality software is critical to inform clinical and regulatory decisions:
    -   Good coding practices for easier review & transparency
    -   Reproducible outputs, especially for stochastic algorithms
    -   Self-sufficient documentation

## Case Study: `{mmrm}` Package

-   Linear model for dependent observations within independent subjects
-   Multiple covariance structures for the dependent observations
-   REML or ML estimation, using multiple optimizers if needed
-   `emmeans` interface for least square means, `tidymodels` for easy model fitting
-   Satterthwaite and Kenward-Roger adjustments for degrees of freedom

## Why do we need a package for MMRMs?

-   MMRM popular for longitudinal continuous outcomes in randomized clinical trials
-   No tailored R package with sufficient capabilities/reliability
-   `lme4` + `lmerTest`: fails on large data sets </br> (slow, convergance issues)
-   `nlme`: no Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom, convergence issues, only approximate `emmeans`

## Before creating a new package

-   Try to improve existing package
    -   extend `glmmTMB` with Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom
    -   not feasible: `glmmTMB` only random effects representation, no real unstructured model
-   Think about long term maintenance and responsibility

## Enter `{mmrm}`

-   Designed for needs of pharma applications from ground up
-   Ongoing maintenance and support from the pharma industry
    - 5 companies involved in the development
    - ambition to become standard package within the field
-   Show-case for high-quality package development

## Lessons Learned: Best Practices

-   User interface design: spend enough time on making it convenient/familiar
-   Version control with git: cornerstone of effective collaboration
-   Unit and integration tests: essential for quality assurance
-   Consistent and readable code style: transparency and easier collaboration
-   Documentation: increases trust
-   Continuous integration: important for effective collaboration and catching errors early
-   Regular online developer calls to align next steps

## Comparing `{mmrm}` and SAS

An MMRM can be built in SAS with `PROC MIXED`.

## Getting started with `{mmrm}`

-   `{mmrm}` is on CRAN - use this as a starting point:

. . .

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("mmrm")
library(mmrm)
fit <- mmrm(
  formula = FEV1 ~ RACE + SEX + ARMCD * AVISIT + us(AVISIT | USUBJID),
  data = fev_data
)
summary(fit)
library(emmeans)
emmeans(fit, ~ ARMCD | AVISIT)
```

-   Visit [openpharma.github.io/mmrm](https://openpharma.github.io/mmrm/) for detailed docs



## Lessons Learned: Cross Industry Collaboration

-   We created an initial prototype quickly and open sourced it on github.com/openpharma/mmrm
-   In parallel we assembled multiple other companies - many of them had also struggled to implement MMRM in R (crucial gap in toolbox so far)
-   This was the start of the Software Engineering working group (SWE WG), with \>35 members from \>25 organizations
-   Read more at rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg, Official working group of the ASA Biopharmaceutical section

## Long Term Perspective

-   Software engineering is a critical competence in producing high-quality statistical software
-   A lot of work needs to be done regarding the establishment, dissemination and adoption of best practices for engineering open-source software
-   Improving the way software engineering is done will help improve the efficiency, reliability and innovation within Biostatistics

## Next Steps

-   Continue to highlight and support cross-industry collaboration through, e.g.: Phuse, R Consortium, openpharma

-   Publicize existing open source projects, e.g.: `admiral`, `rtables`, Bayesian `mmrm`

-   Contribute!
