# Introducing the Working Group

## Software Engineering Working Group

```{r calc-stats}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
members <- read_csv("../data/members.csv") |> filter(SWE_WG_Member == 1)
n_members <- nrow(members)
unique_orgs <- members |> pull("Affiliation") |> unique() |> sort()
```

  - Formed in 19 August 2022
  - Cross-industry collaboration (`r n_members` members from `r length(unique_orgs)` organizations)
  - Short name: `openstatsware`
  - Homepage: [rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg)

## Working Group Objectives

- Primary 
  - Engineer R packages that implement important statistical methods
    - to fill in gaps in the open-source statistical software landscape
    - focusing on what is needed for biopharmaceutical applications
- Secondary 
  - Develop and disseminate best practices for engineering high-quality open-source statistical software
    - By actively doing the statistical engineering work together, we align on best practices and can communicate these to others

## Workstreams in R Package Development

- Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRM) [ðŸŒŽ](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg/mmrm_R_package.html)
  - Develop `mmrm` R package for frequentist inference in MMRM ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mmrm))
- Bayesian MMRM [ðŸŒŽ](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg/bayesian_mmrm_R_package.html)
  - Develop `brms.mmrm` R package for Bayesian inference in MMRM ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brms.mmrm))
- Health Technology Assessment [ðŸŒŽ](https://github.com/hta-pharma/)
  - Develop open-source R tools to support HTA dossier submission across various countries
  - Particularly topics with unmet needs in R implementation and/or related to EUnetHTA

## Best Practices Dissemination

- Workshop "Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages" on world tour
  - to teach hands-on skills and tools to engineer reliable R packages
  - 5 events so far at Basel, Shanghai, San JosÃ©, Rockville, and Montreal
- Youtube video series "Statistical Software Engineering 101" [ðŸŒŽ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL848NFA2PWgCR35n02yn1ZV7JqSu3NMxS)
  - to introduce tips and tricks for good statistical software engineering practices
  - 2 videos so far

# R Package `mmrm` {background-image="slide-background-mmrm.png"}

## Motivation

- MMRM is a popular choice for analyzing longitudinal continuous outcomes in randomized clinical trials
- No great R package 
  - Initially thought that the MMRM problem was solved by using `lme4` with `lmerTest`, learned that this approach failed on large data sets (slow, did not converge)
  - `nlme` does not give Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom, has convergence issues, and with `emmeans` it is only approximate
  - Next we tried to extend `glmmTMB` to calculate Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom, but it did not work

## Idea

- We only want to fit a fixed effects model with a structured covariance matrix for each subject
- The idea is then to use the Template Model Builder (`TMB`) directly - as it is also underlying `glmmTMB` - but code the exact model we want
- We do this by implementing the log-likelihood in `C++` using the `TMB` provided libraries

## Advantages of `TMB`

- Fast `C++` framework for defining objective functions (`Rcpp` would have been alternative interface)
- Automatic differentiation of the log-likelihood as a function of the variance parameters
- We get the gradient and Hessian exactly and without additional coding
- This can be used from the R side with the `TMB` interface and plugged into optimizers

## Why It's Not Just Another Package

- Ongoing maintenance and support from the pharmaceutical industry
  - 5 companies being involved in the development, on track to become standard package
- Development using best practices as show case for high quality package
  - Thorough unit and integration tests (also comparing with SAS results) to ensure accurate results

## Features of `mmrm` {.smaller}

- Linear model for dependent observations within independent subjects
- Covariance structures for the dependent observations:
  - Unstructured, Toeplitz, AR1, compound symmetry, ante-dependence, spatial exponential
  - Allows group specific covariance estimates and weights
- REML or ML estimation, using multiple optimizers if needed
- `emmeans` interface for least square means
- `tidymodels` for easy model fitting
- Satterthwaite and Kenward-Roger adjustments
- Robust sandwich estimator for covariance

## Comparison with Other Software

- We have run comparison analyses with other R packages, namely `nlme`, `glmmTMB` and `lme4`
- Also compared with SAS `PROC GLIMMIX`
- Highlights 
  - `mmrm` has faster convergence time 
  - `mmrm` provides closest results to `PROC GLIMMIX`
- Detailed results at the online [comparison vignette](https://openpharma.github.io/mmrm/main/articles/mmrm_review_methods.html)
