## Why a new WG?

- Started with specific R-package project (more below)
- Makes sense to stay together as a group also for other package projects
- New focus on good engineering practices and collaborative work
- Importance of reliable software for statistical analysis can not be underestimated
- Be rooted in the biostatistics community (rather than statistical programming)

## But there are other WGs?

- Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software (CAMIS) of PhUSE 
[ðŸŒŽ](https://advance.phuse.global/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=327874)
- Application and Implementation of Methodologies in Statistics (AIMS) Special Interest Group (SIG) of PSI [ðŸŒŽ](https://www.psiweb.org/sigs-special-interest-groups/aims)
- R Submission Working Group of R Consortium [ðŸŒŽ](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/)
- R Tables for Regulatory Submissions Working Group of R Consortium [ðŸŒŽ](https://rconsortium.github.io/rtrs-wg/)
- R Validation Hub [ðŸŒŽ](https://pharmar.org)
- R Repositories WG of R Consortium [ðŸŒŽ](https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg)

## WG Objectives

- Primary: 
  - Engineer R packages that implement important statistical methods
  - ... to fill in gaps in the open-source statistical software landscape
  - ... focusing on what is needed for biopharmaceutical applications
- Secondary: 
  - Develop and disseminate best practices for engineering high-quality open-source statistical software
- By actively doing the statistical engineering work together, we align on best practices and can communicate these to others

## Relation to the validation topic

- Validation is on every one's mind when talking about open source in Pharma:
  - "Establishing documented evidence which provides a high degree of assurance (accuracy) that a specific process consistently (reproducibility) produces a product meeting its predetermined specifications (traceability) and quality attributes."
- The [R Validation Hub](https://www.pharmar.org/) is a collaboration to support the adoption of R within a biopharmaceutical regulatory setting
  - Develops tools that supports risk assessment of R packages

## Relation to the validation topic (cont'd)

- Base R and recommended packages are developed by the R Foundation, developed using best practices.
- Our working group is spreading the word about best development practices such that contributed packages can achieve the same level of quality, hence aiding subsequent validation of them.
- And we develop specific R packages with these best practices that can thus be easily validated.

## Members and meetings

```{r calc-stats}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
members <- read_csv("../data/members.csv") |> filter(SWE_WG_Member == 1)
n_members <- nrow(members)
unique_orgs <- members |> pull("Affiliation") |> unique() |> sort()
```

- Currently `r n_members` members
  - new members are welcome! (incl. academia/regulators/etc.)
- Currently `r length(unique_orgs)` organizations
  - `r paste(unique_orgs, collapse = ", ")`
- Meet every 2 weeks

## Workstreams

- Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRM) [ðŸŒŽ](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg/mmrm_R_package.html)
  - Develop `mmrm` (see below) to use frequentist inference in MMRM
- Bayesian MMRM [ðŸŒŽ](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg/bayesian_mmrm_R_package.html)
  - Develop `brms.mmrm` (see below)
- Health Technology Assessment [ðŸŒŽ](https://github.com/hta-pharma/)
  - Develop open-source R tools to support HTA dossier submission across various countries, particularly the topics with unmet needs in R implementation and/or related to EUnetHTA
- Note: Also "just" contributing to workstreams is great!

# Achievements in the first year

## New R packages released to CRAN

- `mmrm` 
  - R package for frequentist inference in MMRM, based on `TMB` (which provides automatic differentiation in `C++` and R frontend)
  - See documentation [ðŸŒŽ](https://openpharma.github.io/mmrm/)
  - Easiest to install from CRAN [ðŸŒŽ](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mmrm)
- `brms.mmrm` 
  - R package for Bayesian inference in MMRM, based on `brms` (as Stan frontend for HMC sampling)
  - See documentation [ðŸŒŽ](https://openpharma.github.io/brms.mmrm/)
  - Easiest to install from CRAN [ðŸŒŽ](https://cran.r-project.org/package=brms.mmrm)

## Why was the MMRM topic important?

- MMRM is a popular analysis method for longitudinal continuous outcomes in randomized clinical trials
- No tailored R package with sufficient capabilities/reliability
- Also used as backbone for more recent methods such as multiple imputation
- We have run comparison analyses with other R packages, namely `nlme`, `glmmTMB` and `lme4` as well as SAS `PROC GLIMMIX` and have found that `mmrm` is the fastest of them and provides closest results to `PROC GLIMMIX`

## Best practices

- Includes version control, git workflow, code review, unit/integration testing, continuous integration/delivery (ci/cd), reproducibility, change log, documentation, package design, user experience, maintainability, publication, etc.
- Workshop "Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages" on world tour
  - Basel, Shanghai, San JosÃ©, Rockville (last Tuesday), Montreal [ðŸŒŽ](https://openpharma.github.io/workshop-r-swe-mtl/)
- Start of video series "Statistical Software Engineering 101" [ðŸŒŽ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL848NFA2PWgCR35n02yn1ZV7JqSu3NMxS)
  - currently 2 videos, hopefully we can still produce more content

## Conference contributions and Publications

- Dedicated sessions with discussions at ISCB, CEN, ASA/FDA workshop (now)
- Presentations at PSI, JSM, Pharma RUG, BBS, etc. [ðŸŒŽ](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg/presentations.html)
- BIOP Report [ðŸŒŽ](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg/blog/biop_report/)
- Blog [ðŸŒŽ](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg/blog.html)

# Ingredients for successful and sustainable collaboration

## Human factors

- Mutual interest and mutual trust
- Prerequisite is getting to know each other
  - Although mostly just online, biweekly calls help a lot with this
- Reciprocity mindset
  - "Reciprocity means that in response to friendly actions, people are frequently much nicer and much more cooperative than predicted by the self-interest model"
  - Personal experience: If you first give away something, more will come back to you.

## Development process

- Important to go public as soon as possible 
  - don't wait for the product to be finished
  - you never know who else might be interested/could help
- Version control with git
  - cornerstone of effective collaboration
- Building software together works better than alone
  - Different perspectives in discussions and code review help to optimize the user interface and thus experience

## Coding standards

- Consistent and readable code style simplifies joint work
- Written (!) contribution guidelines help
- Lowering the entry hurdle using developer calls is important

## Robust test suite

- Unit and integration tests are essential for preventing regression and assuring quality
- Especially with compiled code critical to see if package works correctly
- Use continuous integration during development to make sure nothing breaks along the way

## Documentation

- Lots of work but extremely important 
  - start with writing up the methods details
  - think about the code structure first in a "design doc"
  - only then put the code in the package
- Needs to be kept up-to-date
- Need to have examples & vignettes
  - Testing alone is not sufficient 
  - Builds trust with users
  - Reference for developers over time

# Long term vision

## Vision: Statisticians have software engineering skills

- These skills are taught at university
- Statisticians can use basic practices in their daily work ...
- ... to ensure reproducibility of statistical analyses and research results
  
## Vision: Innovation does not stop with publication

- Methods research does not end when the first methods paper is published
- Initial prototype code as paper supplement is not sufficient
- Continue to developing open source and reliably tested software packages ...
- ... to enable users to easily use the new methodology in their own applications

## Vision: Industry develops common code base

- Increasingly companies work in the open source as much as possible
- Rather than repeating similar developments internally ...
- ... to become more cost-effective and transparent towards society

# Next steps

## R Packages

- New workstream on covariate adjustment is starting up
- Think more strategically about identifying gaps in the statistical software landscape
- Help maintaining the CRAN Task View on Clinical Trials

## Branding and Collaboration

- Publicize our new short name `openstatsware`
- Proposed to associate also with EFSPI to emphasize global nature of the group
- Ensure a strong connection to the new pan-pharma methodology group

## Communication and Outreach

- Add more content to our video series 
- Start a chat channel to start informal discussions within larger community
- Organize hackathons working together on workstream packages e.g.
