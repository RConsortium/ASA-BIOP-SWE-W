## Motivation

-   2 years ago, we thought we had solved the MMRM problem, using `lme4` and `lmerTest`
-   However in March this year, Gonzalo and Julia told us the bad news: this approach failed on their Ophthalmology data sets (slow, did not converge)
-   `nlme` does not give Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom, has convergence issues, and with `emmeans` it is only approximate
-   Next we tried to extend `glmmTMB` to calculate Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom, but it did not work

## Idea

-   Because `glmmTMB` is always using a random effects representation, we cannot have a real unstructured model (uses $\sigma = \varepsilon > 0$ trick)
-   We only want to fit a fixed effects model with a structured covariance matrix for each subject
-   The idea is then to use the Template Model Builder (`TMB`) directly - as it is also underlying `glmmTMB` - but code the exact model we want
-   We do this by implementing the log-likelihood in `C++` using the `TMB` provided libraries 

## Advantages of `TMB`

-   Since we use `C++` it is fast (but `Rcpp` could also have been used instead)
-   Automatic differentiation of the log-likelihood as a function of the variance parameters
-   We get the gradient and Hessian exactly and without additional coding
-   This can be used from the R side with the `TMB` interface and plugged into optimizers

## Cross-industry collaboration

-   We created an initial prototype quickly and open sourced it on [github.com/openpharma/mmrm](https://github.com/openpharma/mmrm)
-   In parallel we assembled multiple other companies - many of them had also struggled to implement MMRM in R
-   This was the start of the Software Engineering working group (SWE WG)

## Features

-   Linear model for dependent observations within independent subjects   
-   Covariance structures for the dependent observations: 
    - Unstructured, Toeplitz, AR1, compound symmetry, ante-dependence, spatial exponential
    - Allows group specific covariance estimates and weights
-   REML or ML estimation, using multiple optimizers if needed
-   `emmeans` interface for least square means
-   Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom

## Getting started

-   `mmrm` is on CRAN - use this as a starting point:

. . .

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("mmrm")
library(mmrm)
fit <- mmrm(
  formula = FEV1 ~ RACE + SEX + ARMCD * AVISIT + us(AVISIT | USUBJID),
  data = fev_data
)
summary(fit)
library(emmeans)
emmeans(fit, ~ ARMCD | AVISIT)
```

-   Visit [openpharma.github.io/mmrm](https://openpharma.github.io/mmrm/) for detailed docs including vignettes
-   Consider [tern.mmrm](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern.mmrm/main/) for high-level clinical reporting interface, incl. standard tables and graphs

## Outlook

-   We still have major features on our backlog:
    -   Kenward-Roger (improved variance-covariance matrix, degrees of freedom)
    -   Robust sandwich estimator for covariance matrix (important when not using unstructured covariance)
    -   Type II and type III ANOVA tests
-   Working on comparison to other implementations
    -   Parameter estimates, computation time, convergence, ...
-   Please let us know what is missing in `mmrm` for you!

## Thank you! Questions?
