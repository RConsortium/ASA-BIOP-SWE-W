## ASA BIOP Software Engineering working group (SWE WG)

-   An official working group of the ASA Biopharmaceutical Section
-   Formed in August 2022
-   Cross-industry collaboration with more than 30 members from over 20 organizations
-   Home page at [rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg)


## Motivation

-   Open-source software has gained increasing popularity in Biostatistics over the last two decades
    -   Pros: rapid uptake of novel statistical methods and unprecedented opportunities for collaboration and innovation
    -   Cons: users face huge variability in software quality, in particular reliability, efficiency and maintainability 
-   Developing high-quality software with good coding practices, reproducible outputs, and self-sufficient documentation is critical to inform clinical and regulatory decisions


## Goals

-   **Primary Goal**: Collaborate to engineer R packages that implement important statistical methods to fill in critical gaps

-   **Secondary Goal**: Develop and disseminate best practices for engineering high-quality open-source statistical software


## SWE WG Activities

-   First R package `mmrm` was published on CRAN in October 2022 and updated in December
    -  We aim to estabilish this package as a new standard for fitting mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM)
    -  We have been developing and adopting best practices for software in the `mmrm` package, and open sourced it at [github.com/openpharma/mmrm](https://github.com/openpharma/mmrm) 
    -  Currently under active development to add more features


## SWE WG Activities (con't)

-   Prepare public training materials to disseminate best practice for software engineering in the Biostatistics community
    -  At the beginning of February, a face-to-face workshop will take place in Basel, Switzerland with a focus on open-source software for clinical trials 
    -  Organize conference sessions with a focus on statistical software engineering at CEN, JSM and ASA/FDA Workshop 
    -  Video clips in preparation with a focus on best practices for software engineering


## Long term perspective 

-   Software engineering is a critical competence in producing high-quality statistical software
-   A lot of work need to be done regarding the establishment, dissemination and adoption of best practices for engineering open-source software
-   Improving the way software engineering is done will help improve the efficiency, reliability and innovation within Biostatistics
