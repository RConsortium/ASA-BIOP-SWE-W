## Motivation

-   2 years ago, we thought we had solved the MMRM problem, using `lme4` and `lmerTest`
-   However in March this year, Gonzalo and Julia told us the bad news: this approach failed on their Ophthalmology data sets (slow, did not converge)
-   `nlme` did not give Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom, and with `emmeans` it is only approximate, also has convergence issues
-   Next we tried to extend `glmmTMB` to calculate Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom. But it did not work.

## Idea

-   Because `glmmTMB` is always using a random effects representation, cannot have a real unstructured model (need to use a trick)
-   We only want to fit a fixed effects model with a structured covariance matrix for each subject.
-   The idea was to use the Template Model Builder (`TMB`) directly - as it is also underlying `glmmTMB` and code exactly the model we want.
-   Basically we need to write the log-likelihood in `C++` using the `TMB` provided libraries (`Eigen` etc.)

## Advantages of `TMB`

-   Since we use `C++` it is fast (but `Rcpp` could also have been used instead)
-   Automatic differentiation of the log-likelihood as a function of the variance parameters
-   Therefore we get the gradient and Hessian exactly and without additional coding
-   This can be used from the R side with the `TMB` interface and plugged into optimization functions

## Cross-industry collaboration

-   We created an initial prototype quickly and open sourced it on [github.com/openpharma/mmrm](https://github.com/openpharma/mmrm)
-   In parallel we assembled multiple other companies - many of them had been struggling to implement MMRM in R reliably too.
-   This was the start of the Software Engineering working group (SWE WG)

## Features

-   Continuous responses with normal residuals.
-   Marginal linear models (no individual-level random effects).
-   Covariance structures: Unstructured, Toeplitz, AR1, compound symmetry, ante-dependence and spatial exponential. Allows group specific covariance estimates.
-   REML or ML estimation, weighted observations.
-   `emmeans` package can be used to obtain least square means and test linear contrasts.
-   Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom.

## Getting started

-   `mmrm` is on CRAN. Use this as a starting point:

. . .

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("mmrm")
library(mmrm)
fit <- mmrm(
  formula = FEV1 ~ RACE + SEX + ARMCD * AVISIT + us(AVISIT | USUBJID),
  data = fev_data
)
summary(fit)
library(emmeans)
emmeans(fit, ~ ARMCD | AVISIT)
```

-   Visit [openpharma.github.io/mmrm](https://openpharma.github.io/mmrm/) for detailed docs including vignettes
-   Consider [tern.mmrm](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tern.mmrm/main/) for high-level clinical reporting interface, incl. standard tables and graphs

## Outlook

- We still have major features on our backlog:
  - Kenward-Roger (improved variance-covariance matrix, degrees of freedom)
  - Robust sandwich estimator for covariance matrix (important when not using unstructured covariance)
  - Type II and type III Anova tests
- Working on comparison to other implementations 
  - regarding estimates, computation time, convergence 
- Please let us know what is missing for you!

## Thank you! Questions?
