## Agenda

-   Introduction and Overview of AWA SWE

-   Mix Models for Repeated Measures - Why is it a Problem?

-   MMRM Package

    -   Why this is not "yet another package"

    -   Long Term Perspective

    -   Comparing MMRM R Package to SAS - Demo

-   Closing and Next Steps

## Software Engineering in Biostatistics

-   Open-source software has gained increasing popularity in Biostatistics over the last two decades
    -   Pros: rapid uptake of novel statistical methods and unprecedented opportunities for collaboration and innovation
    -   Cons: users face huge variability in software quality, in particular reliability, efficiency and maintainability 
-   Developing high-quality software with good coding practices, reproducible outputs, and self-sufficient documentation is critical to inform clinical and regulatory decisions

## How to deal with these issues?

-   To deal with the issues of statistical quality assurances for R packages and creating high quality statistical software a group came together to create through the ASA called the "Software Engineering Working Group" SWE WG to look R packages from a statistical point of view

## ASA BIOP Software Engineering working group (SWE WG)

-   An official working group of the ASA Biopharmaceutical Section
-   Formed in August 2022
-   Cross-industry collaboration with more than 30 members from over 20 organizations
-   Home page at [rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg](https://rconsortium.github.io/asa-biop-swe-wg)

## Goals

-   **Primary Goal**: Collaborate to engineer R packages that implement important statistical methods to fill in critical gaps

-   **Secondary Goal**: Develop and disseminate best practices for engineering high-quality open-source statistical software

## SWE WG Activities

-   First R package `mmrm` was published on CRAN in October 2022 and updated in December
    -  We aim to estabilish this package as a new standard for fitting mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM)
    -  We have been developing and adopting best practices for software in the `mmrm` package, and open sourced it at [github.com/openpharma/mmrm](https://github.com/openpharma/mmrm) 
    -  Currently under active development to add more features
        
## WHY MMRM?
-   Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRM) is a popular choice for analyzing longitudinal continuous outcomes in randomized clinical trials
-   No great R Package - initially though that the MMRM problem was solved by using a combination of `lme4` and `lmerTest`
-   Learned that this approach failed on Ophthalamology data (slow, did not converge
-   `nlme` does not give Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom, has convergence issues, and with `emmeans` it is only approximate
-   tried to extend `glmmTMB` to calculate Satterthwaite adjusted degrees of freedom

## Idea

-   Because `glmmTMB` is always using a random effects representation, we cannot have a real unstructured model (uses $\sigma = \varepsilon > 0$ trick)
-   We only want to fit a fixed effects model with a structured covariance matrix for each subject
-   The idea is then to use the Template Model Builder (`TMB`) directly - as it is also underlying `glmmTMB` - but code the exact model we want
-   We do this by implementing the log-likelihood in `C++` using the `TMB` provided libraries

## Advantages of `TMB`

-   Fast `C++` framework for defining objective functions (`Rcpp` would have been alternative interface)
-   Automatic differentiation of the log-likelihood as a function of the variance parameters
-   We get the gradient and Hessian exactly and without additional coding
-   This can be used from the R side with the `TMB` interface and plugged into optimizers


## What's next with {mmrm} and SWE WG

-   Prepare public training materials to disseminate best practice for software engineering in the Biostatistics community
    -  At the beginning of February, a face-to-face workshop will take place in Basel, Switzerland with a focus on open-source software for clinical trials 
    -  Organize conference sessions with a focus on statistical software engineering at CEN, JSM and ASA/FDA Workshop 
    -  Video clips in preparation with a focus on best practices for software engineering
    
## Why it's not just another package

- Ongoing maintenance and support from the pharmaceutical industry that is supported by American Statistical Association 
- Package is part of the mission, but to emphasize our goal is to push out information on practices for engineering high-quality open-source statistical software
    
## Long term perspective 

-   Software engineering is a critical competence in producing high-quality statistical software
-   A lot of work need to be done regarding the establishment, dissemination and adoption of best practices for engineering open-source software
-   Improving the way software engineering is done will help improve the efficiency, reliability and innovation within Biostatistics
